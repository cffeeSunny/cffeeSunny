## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This repo is for my own projects / all things I've done. Its goal is to actively showcase how I have improved + new skills I have gained.
I would love to receive constructive feedback - I am sure there is plenty to be had. 
Week 6 was unfortunately done on an old laptop no longer here;   shame, it was my favourite so far.
